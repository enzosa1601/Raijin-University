            The Raijin educational institution originated in 2020 from a
            literacy class located in the modest neighborhood of Duque de
            Cacxas, a city in Rio de Janeiro. In 2021, the institution's
            founder, Professor Farid Germano Filho, received the title of
            Educator of the Year.
          </p>

          <p>
            The founder's dream came true with the creation of the Raijin School
            of Engineering, in 2020, authorized by Decree No. 70,828, of July
            13, 2020. Since its origin, the sense of mission, the fundamental
            values ​​of education and the guidelines present in the Raijin
            permeated the creation of its faculties and guided its actions,
            giving rise to a latent desire for integration, which was
            consolidated with its unification in the Integrated Colleges Raijin,
            in 2021.
          </p>

          <p>
            Finally, at a meeting held on November 10, 2021, the Federal Council
            of Education unanimously approved - an act ratified by Ordinance No.
            1725, of November 20, 2020 -, the transformation of the Integrated
            Colleges Raijin into Raijin University (RNU). The history and
            scenario described here do not exhaust the institution's
            achievements. Rather, they represent a description of the
            significant milestones in its more than seven decades of existence,
            characterized by the spirit of collaboration in its actions and
            constant integration with its community.
